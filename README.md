ATtiny85 Pixel Switcher
================================

For use with ATtiny85 (or Arduino!) and WS2811 LEDs

* Download the [NeoPixel](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel) library
* Get the [ATtiny cores](https://code.google.com/p/arduino-tiny/) for Arduino & a [programmer](https://www.adafruit.com/products/46)
* Attach your LED data line to Digital Pin 4
* Attach momentary push button/switch to Digital Pin 0
* Upload and make patterns :-)

Need help getting started with ATtiny and lights? I wrote an [Instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/Use-a-1-ATTiny-to-drive-addressable-RGB-LEDs/) on the subject.
