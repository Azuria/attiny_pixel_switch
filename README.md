ATtiny85 Pixel Switcher
================================

For use with ATtiny85 (or Arduino!) and WS2811 LEDs

* Download Adafruit's [NeoPixel](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel) library
* Get the [ATtiny cores](https://code.google.com/p/arduino-tiny/) for Arduino & a [programmer](https://www.adafruit.com/products/46)
* Attach your LED data line to Digital Pin 4
* Attach momentary push button/switch to Digital Pin 0
* Upload the sample sketch and enjoy your light show! 
* Create and share patterns of your own :-)
